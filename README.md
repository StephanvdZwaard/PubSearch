### Background 

Every week, many articles are published. It is easy to get overwhelmed as a researcher. Signing up for RSS feeds, PubMed searchers, or scrolling through Twitter for newly tweeted articles. Often, tracking all the newly published articles via all these different ways costs quite a bit of energy. Therefore, for scientists in sport science or exercise physiology, I wanted to make life a little easier by automatically summarising the most recently published articles in the previous week and the attention they received, as indicated by their Altmetric score. This way, you make a habit out of quickly scanning the most relevant articles for you, which are published in some of the top journals in the field. 

### Application
With the PubSearch application you will be able to quickly discover the most recently published articles in Sports Science & Exercise Physiology. With one click you can download these in a simple XLS-file or you can click the articles that are relevant for you and only export these.

This application is deployed on https://svdzwaard.shinyapps.io/PubSearch/
